# CHAPTER ZERO

If you want to ignore a folder in Git without using a `.gitignore` file, you can use the `git update-index` command with the `--skip-worktree` option. This option allows you to inform Git to temporarily ignore changes to a file or directory.

Here's an example of how you can use it for a folder:

```bash
# Assume your folder is named "ignore_folder"
# Navigate to the root of your Git repository
cd /path/to/your/repo

# Mark the folder to be skipped
git update-index --skip-worktree ignore_folder
```

Keep in mind that this approach is local to your specific clone of the repository. Other contributors or clones won't be affected, and the folder will not be ignored for them.

If you later want to start tracking changes in that folder again, you can use the following command:

```bash
git update-index --no-skip-worktree ignore_folder
```

If you want a more global solution that affects all clones and contributors, it's generally better to use a `.gitignore` file, even if you want to avoid adding it to the repository. You can add a local `.gitignore` file in your working directory without committing it:

```bash
# Create a local .gitignore file
echo "ignore_folder/" > .gitignore

# Add it to the repository's configuration (but don't commit)
git add .gitignore
```

This way, the ignored folder won't be tracked, and the local `.gitignore` file remains uncommitted.
